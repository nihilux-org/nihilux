## nihilux.org

nihilux is under construction and would like to be an expression in virtuality of the changes happening in reality

nihilux is an old thing I'm deeply attached to ; I've done my best to take care of it all the way through

nihilux is an aggregation of projects trying to aggregate people to do things with different perspectives

nihilux will grow if it finds an echo in the world

if not, this piece of virtuality will shut down, because we need to focus on reality

let's forget our egos and heal the present

we're all in this together,

wish you the best, 

have fun,

take care,

enjoy...

nihil
